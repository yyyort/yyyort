## Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I am Ian Troy Pahilga

I am an Aspriring Full Stack Developer and a fresh Computer Science Graduate at the University of San Agustin.
I am a jack of all trades and is eager to learn and try anything that interests me in tech, from Web, Mobile, Game, and AI. I mainly focus on Full Stack Development, I use React, and NextJs for my Front End, Node and ExpressJS for the Back End, and PostgreSQL for SQL Database. Aside from that I have previous experience with mobile cross-platform before using Flutter and Firebase as a BaaS, alongside implementing a computer vision with it in my thesis project.

I'm also currently learning React Native for mobile development and ASP.NET Core for backend development.
